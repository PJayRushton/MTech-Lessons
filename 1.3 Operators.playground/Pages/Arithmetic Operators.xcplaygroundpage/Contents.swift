//: ### Addition

let myScore = 3 + 3 + 2
let opponentScore = 3 + 2 + 2

//: You can also perform math on variables directly
let totalPointsScored = myScore + opponentScore
//: And that also applies to not just numbers but strings
let fullName = "Jonny" + " " + "Appleseed"

//: ### Subtraction
let winningMargin = myScore - opponentScore

//: ### Multiplication
let windowsPerRoom = 2
let numbersOfRooms = 5

let totalWindows = 2 * 5
let totalWindowsAgain = windowsPerRoom * numbersOfRooms

//: ### Division (Integer)
var totalNumbersOfCookies = 12
let numberOfGuests = 4
let cookiesPerGuest = totalNumbersOfCookies / numberOfGuests
