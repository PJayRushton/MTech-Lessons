//: 1. Do this in an Xcode PROJECT (not a playground)
//: 1. Create a constant called *myView* and make it of type `UIView` (Import UIKit)
//: 1. Option-Click the variable to get the Quick Help guide (if option click shows nothing, go to Preferences > Navigation > option-click)
//: 1. Tell me what class is UIView a subclass of

import UIKit
let myView = UIView()

//: **Challenge 4** Show header files
//: 1. use Command-Click to be shown the public header file for the class
//: 1. Command-Click `UIView()` and tell me what you might be able to use to disable user interaction
//: 1. Disable user interaction on `myView`

//: Xcode Documentation window

//: Xcode contains its own version of documentation locally

//: It can be launched in one of 3 ways
//: 1. Use your mouse to click on Window > Developer Documentation to launch
//: 1. Use the shortcut (Shift-Command-0)
//: 1. Use Control-Option-Command-/ while your cursor is on a class name to jump right to the documentation of that thing

// **Challenge 5** Open the Developer Documentation straight to the UIView documentation using the shortcut.

//: Part 2: Use the search functionality to find something from AR Kit
