//: # Sources of truth

//: ## Search Engine
//: You MIGHT get a good blog or article about what you need.
//: and then it MIGHT be written recently enough for you to be able to find the solution you're looking for

//: ## Stack Overflow
//: SOMETIMES you get a good answer.

//: Sometimes other developers are lemmings and accept something that WORKS but its actually terribly inefficient.

//: ## Official Apple Documentation
//: Its NOT PERFECT. (In fact many frameworks are highly lacking documentation (See SwiftUI))

//: But the main things you use (UIKit, Foundation, Core Animation, Core Graphics etc.) are WELL documented)

//: Rule of thumb:
//: 1. Read the appropriate Apple documentation first
//: 2. Then search Google looking for blog/article from reputable source
//: 3. Then settle for Stack Overflow answers
