//: ## Outside Xcode:
//: ## Online Docs (developer.apple.com/documentation) (Or just google the class or type you're looking for)

//: **CHALLENGE 1 (Cafe)**: Here's a string:
let example1 = "Cafe"
//: This word is actually a french word however, and should have an accent mark on the `e`

//: **Look at the documentation for STRING to figure out how to create a string that will print out as the correct spelling with an accent mark**

//: **Challenge 2 (PalindrWHAT?)** A Palindrome is a word that is spelled the same backwards and forwards ("racecar", "radar", "kayak", "madam" etc.)

//: Write a function that can determine if a single word is a palindrome (Hint: Keep reading the String Documentation)

//: Another hint: you may need to go beyond apple documentation to get this one to work

// Challenge 1
let answer = "Por que\u{301}?"
print(answer)


// Challenge 2

    guard !subject.contains(" ") else { return false }
    return subject.lowercased() == String(subject.lowercased().reversed())
}

let tests = ["racecar", "banana"]

        print("âœ…")
